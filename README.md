# Star Wars RPG

This is a simple Javascript RPG game that allows the player to choose one of four characters to fight as. Each character has different base stats for Health Points (HP), Initial Attack Power, Attack Power, and Counter Attack Power.

The player character starts with only their initial attack power, and each time they attack, their power increases by their attack stat. The power that the player character accrues between battles carries over to the next battle. The enemy character only has Counter Attack Power, which never changes.

In order to win the game, the player must consider which opponents they should fight first based on their counter attack power and avoid losing all of their HP before beating all of the opponents.
